### Build Log
#### 03/29/21
Starting with authorization with firebaseui. Installed, and visable, but hella ugly. Need to clean it up.

Styling functional now. Need to break into a Login component. Header will have Sign In if not logged in and 'My Journal' & 'Sign Out' if signed in. 

Able to read if a user is signed in or not. Need to get a user collection created on new user still.
